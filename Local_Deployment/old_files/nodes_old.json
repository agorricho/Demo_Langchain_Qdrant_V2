This privilege is referred to as rights of accumulation. \nLetters of Intent: Some mutual funds will grant breakpoint discounts at a lower investment level if an investor signs a \u201cLetter of \nIntent\u201d claiming an intention to invest a speci\ufb01ed amount in the fund over a speci\ufb01ed period of time.

C \nShares typically charge an annual 12b-1 fee of 0.50% to 1%. In most cases there is also a contingent deferred sales charge. \nWhere available and permitted by the applicable mutual fund company, TIS has adopted a policy of converting Class C mutual \nfund shares held in Full-Service brokerage accounts to Class A Shares after being held for a period of six years (subject to the \nterms of each mutual fund\u2019s prospectus).",

This can lead to an investor\npurchasing their shares at a premium or selling their shares at a discount to what the ETF\u2019s underlying holdings are actually \nworth. Except in the case of actively managed ETFs, ETFs typically hold portfolios of securities that correspond to the price and\nyield performance of a particular broad market index or basket of securities for a particular industry, sector, or geographic\nregion, less annual fees and expenses. \nETF Fees and Expenses \nBeing that ETFs are traded on an exchange, you pay a commission in connection with the purchase or sale of an ETF.\nTransactions in ETFs are subject to the applicable Brokerage Account Commission Schedule. ETFs also carry built-in operating \nexpenses that can a\ufb00ect the ETF\u2019s return. \nETF Compensation\nFinancial professionals receive a portion of the commission you pay when you purchase or sell an ETF. \nCon\ufb02icts of Interest\u2013- ETFs \nA similar investment strategy may be o\ufb00ered in both a mutual fund and an ETF. Mutual fund fees can be higher compared to \nthose applicable to ETFs. As a result, we may have an incentive to o\ufb00er funds from mutual fund companies that result in our \nreceipt of greater compensation over ETFs.",

They are generally suited for investors with a long-term investment \nhorizon. Index-based UITs may include the Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, DJIA, MSCI, EAFE, etc. \nFixed Income UITs can receive interest monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually. Of course, there is no guarantee that the \nestimated current return or estimated long-term return will be realized. Fixed income UITs can be categorized in two main \ntypes: taxable and tax free. \nTaxable Fixed Income UITs typically invest in government-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, or corporate bonds,\nand are designed to provide income. Various levels of risk are associated with the different types of taxable income securities. \nTax Free UITs are comprised of bonds issued by states, municipalities, and other municipal bond issuers. These portfolios \nprovide income that is exempt from federal income taxes. A portion of the income, however, may be subject to the Alternative \nMinimum Tax. Stated maturities, credit quality ratings, and the call dates for all bonds held in the UIT are disclosed to investors \nin sales materials and prospectuses. \nSee each UIT\u2019s prospectus for additional risk and other disclosures associated with specific UITs.

In return for the premiums you pay, the issuing insurance company pledges to\nreturn your funds in the future, including earnings if occurred, or to make a series of guaranteed periodic payments (called\nannuitization) to you or anyone else you specify. Annuities can be purchased by making a single payment or by making a series \nof payments over time.

    "text": "In addition, most annuity contracts will \nassess a surrender charge for early withdrawals (see Surrender Charges below). \nIf you purchase an annuity within a tax-qualified retirement plan such as an IRA or 401(k), the tax deferral feature of the\nannuity has no effect because the IRA or qualified plan already provides tax deferral. Therefore, the decision to purchase an\nannuity within a tax-qualified plan should be made on the basis of features and benefits other than tax deferral, such as the \npolicy\u2019s death benefit protection or the opportunity for lifetime income payments, including annuitization. You should also \nevaluate whether the other features and benefits of the annuity and the associated costs justify the purchase within a tax-\nqualified plan. \nIf these features are not needed, you should consider whether your annuity purchase would be more appropriate in a non-tax \nqualified account. \nWhen contemplating an annuity, several factors should be considered, such as, but not limited to: \n\u2022 \nYour liquidity needs \n\u2022 \nYour time horizon when proceeds may be needed \n\u2022 \nYour risk tolerance \n\u2022 \nTotal expenses of an annuity contract \n\u2022 \nTotal return expectations \n\u2022 \nCredit quality of insurance carrier \nLastly, certain annuity contracts offer multiple share class options which can impact pricing and availability of certain insurance\nbenefits. For example, we offer Class B-share variable annuities, as well as certain advisory-based share classes. Other variable \nannuity share classes exist, such as Class L and Class C-share variable annuities, but these are not offered by TIS.",

    "text": "Some annuities do not have a surrender charge period \nor surrender charges. \nSurrender charges are usually calculated as a percentage of the purchase payment withdrawn and decline gradually over the\nsurrender charge period. For example, an 8% surrender charge might apply in the first year after investing, 7% in the second\nyear, 6% in the third year, and so on, until the surrender charge no longer applies. Additional annuity purchase payments\nusually begin a new surrender charge period applicable to those payments, so new purchase payments will in most cases\nextend the surrender charge period on your investments beyond the original surrender charge period established at the\npurchase date. Many annuities allow you to withdraw part of your account value each year without paying a surrender charge.\nDepending on the terms of the contract, the allowable amount is typically (a) your annual credited interest or earnings, or (b)\nan amount up to 10% or 15% of your original purchase payment. In addition, many annuities will allow you to withdraw all or \npart of your account value without paying a surrender charge if certain life events occur. These events typically include\nconfinement to a nursing home or diagnosis of terminal illness. The availability of a waiver of surrender charges in case of such\nevents and the requirements for eligibility will depend on the terms of each individual annuity contract, along with state-\nspecific regulations. \nFixed Annuity Fees and Expenses \nFixed annuities have expenses in addition to the provisions for surrender charges discussed previously.",

These features could be included as part of the\nunderlying variable and fixed indexed annuity contract, or they could be optional features or riders that you can elect at the\ntime of purchase or in the future, depending on the rules of the rider set forth by the annuity carrier. This approach gives you\nthe ability to select and pay only for the features you need. Optional features typically carry an additional annual charge,\nexpressed as an annual percent of either the account value or the benefit base value.",

By investing in a 529 Plan outside your state of residence, you can potentially\nlose certain state tax benefits depending on your state of domicile. \n529 Plan Fees and Expenses \nA 529 Plan can offer investment options with more than one share class to investors, and each class has different fees and \nexpenses. 529 Plans are subject to enrollment, maintenance, administration, and management fees and expenses. Investors \nshould consider each specific 529 Plan\u2019s investments, risks, expenses and tax implications prior to investing. This and other \nimportant information about 529 Plans are contained in the 529 Plan\u2019s disclosure document and prospectus. Please read these \nand the applicable Participant Agreement carefully before you invest. You can contact your TIS financial professional for a copy \nof a specific Plan\u2019s prospectus. \nThe sales charges of our 529 Plan offerings range from 0% - 5.75%, and the12b-1 fees range from 0% - 1%.",

A detailed explanation of these risks and considerations can be found in\nthe offering documents associated with each structured product issuance. \nStructured products are designed to be held to maturity and funds that are needed prior to maturity should not be invested in \na structured product. Investors should take into account their future liquidity needs (such as required minimum distributions \nin an IRA) when considering the purchase of a structured product. Except in limited circumstances specified in the product\u2019s \nsupplement and disclosure statement, or as secondary markets are available, structured product owners will have no right to \nearly termination prior to scheduled maturity. It is important to understand that if you sell a structured product before \nmaturity, you may receive substantially less in sale proceeds than the original deposit amount. Although TIS or one of its \naffiliates may purchase a structured product from an investor prior to maturity, they are not obligated to do so and there is no \nassurance that a secondary market will be established or maintained. \nStructured products will not track the reference assets (market measures) directly, as they are not equivalent to an outright\ninvestment in the reference asset.",

TIS and its affiliates perform services for or solicit business from issuers whose securities are recommended by TIS\nfinancial professionals. TIS and its affiliates also act as brokers, principals, and/or market makers in certain markets and can do\nso in transactions with you. \nWhere permitted under applicable law, TIS is permitted to trade certain products on a principal basis, meaning you are buying \nfrom or selling to our firm\u2019s inventory account. We typically earn compensation by marking up the price of the securities we\nsell to you or by marking down the price of the securities we buy from you. Because TIS receives compensation from \ntransactions, there is a conflict of interest. In order to minimize/alleviate this conflict of interest, we disclose this conflict of \ninterest to you and supervise the recommendations of your TIS financial professional in accordance with industry regulations. \nCompeting Recommendations \nIn the course of conducting its business, financial professionals may find themselves dealing with two separate clients who are\non opposite sides of a transaction (cross trade) or whose investment needs result in opposite recommendations (client A\nwould benefit from purchasing security XYZ, client B would benefit from selling security XYZ). TIS addresses this conflict of \ninterest by requiring all cross trades to go through escalated review and by requiring supervision of recommendations to\nclients in accordance with industry regulations. \nReasonably Available Alternatives \nTIS does not offer all available securities and investment products.",

Some restrictions on the use of loan proceeds from a securities-based line of credit or loan apply under \nthe loan documents and applicable laws and regulations. For example, you may not use a non-purpose securities-based line of \ncredit or loan to purchase securities or to refinance a loan, including a margin loan, used to purchase (\u201ccarry\u201d) securities. Truist \nBank is permitted to, on demand, require you to repay part or all of any outstanding advance, post additional eligible \ncollateral, and sell or force the sale of the pledged securities without notice. Any required liquidations could interrupt your \ninvestment strategies and could result in adverse tax consequences and adverse impacts on your long-term investment goals. \nPledging the securities in one or more of your accounts with us would also limit your authority to give certain orders or \ninstructions regarding those accounts or securities, such as an instruction to make free delivery to you or a third party of any of \nthe pledged securities; and Truist Bank would have authority to take exclusive control of those accounts and securities. Truist \nBank compensates TIS, and TIS will compensate your financial professional, in connection with the origination of a SBL product \nbased upon the amount of the loan or the outstanding balance at any time under the loan. The rate of compensation can differ \nfrom that of a margin loan. This additional compensation creates a conflict of interest.",

Additional information regarding SBL is available at \nhttps://www.truist.com/wealth/solutions/lending. \nFully Paid Securities Lending \nThrough our relationship with National Financial Services LLC (\u201cNFS\u201d), TIS offers a fully paid securities lending (\u201cFPSL\u201d) program\nwhich is designed to offer incremental income to TIS customers through the securities-lending market. TIS customers can \nparticipate in the FPSL program by contracting directly with NFS. \nThe FPSL program is potentially available to you if you hold positions of eligible U.S. equities that may be difficult to borrow; \nconsequently, these securities can be valuable to lend. Generally, FPSL allows you to lend fully paid and excess margin \nsecurities that NFS desires to borrow. NFS borrows as principal and is the counterparty for all loans, which are fully\ncollateralized and marked to market daily. In return, you receive compensation as an interest rate-based lending fee that is\ncalculated by multiplying the loan rate by the market value of the securities on loan. The interest rates paid are based on the\nrelative value of the individual securities in the securities-lending market and are subject to change based upon market\nconditions and borrowing demand. You maintain full economic ownership of the securities on loan and may sell the securities \nor recall the loan at any time.",
