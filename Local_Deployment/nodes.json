We do not always o\ufb00er you mutual fund share classes with \nthe lowest available expense ratio. Mutual funds or mutual fund share classes that would otherwise meet our standards for \ninvestment recommendations will not be recommended by the \ufb01rm and its \ufb01nancial professionals to TIS\u2019 brokerage accounts \nunless TIS receives 12b-1 fees or other compensation from the mutual fund or its a\ufb03liates. \nSome mutual funds carry higher sales charges or operating expenses (including 12b-1 fees and shareholder service fees) than\nothers. This creates an incentive for TIS \ufb01nancial professionals to recommend certain mutual funds because the higher sales\ncharge and/or operating expense level will result in a higher compensation amount to TIS and/or the \ufb01nancial professional. We \nmitigate this con\ufb02ict of interest by disclosing it to clients and by supervising investment recommendations in accordance with \nindustry regulations. However, TIS cannot eliminate this con\ufb02ict of interest as it is inherent in the business model of a securities \nbroker-dealer to be compensated in connection with its transactional brokerage services. \nFeel free to ask your TIS \ufb01nancial professional how he or she will be compensated for any mutual fund transaction.",

Investors purchase units of a portfolio, at a relatively low\nminimum investment, which represent an undivided ownership interest in the assets contained in the portfolio. UITs enable \ninvestors to own a basket of securities with one single purchase, rather than trying to select individual stocks or bonds that \nmeet their objectives. \nUITs differ from mutual funds because they follow a \u201cbuy and hold\u201d philosophy, rather than active management. This means \nthat the maturity of the UIT defines the holding period of the securities. This helps eliminate emotional investing and the\ntemptation to buy and sell for various reasons that an investor cannot control. Of course, should your investment needs \nchange, your choice of UIT may need to be changed. UITs can be liquidated on a daily basis at the redemption price, less any\npossible deferred sales charges, which can be more or less than the original purchase price. \nUITs are primarily offered in two types: equity and fixed income. Within these types, various investment objectives and risk\nlevels are offered, such as diversified UITs vs. sector-oriented UITs, or taxable fixed income vs. municipal fixed income. Please \nconsult with your TIS financial professional to determine your needs. \nFeatures \nUITs provide specific portfolios that are professionally selected by experienced investment professionals, utilizing detailed\nscreening techniques and analysis. In this sense, they are professionally selected but not professionally managed.",

We do not provide \nlegal, tax, or accounting advice. \nTypes of UITs \nEquity UITs are portfolios of domestic and/or international stocks chosen for their attractive valuation in the market and\nexpected future potential for strong, positive total returns. Specifically, equity UITs are provided in three main categories: \nstrategy, specialty, and index based. \nStrategy UITs seek to outperform a benchmark universe of stocks by refining the universe through predetermined investment \ncriteria that reflect the historical behavior of the securities. There is no guarantee that this objective will be met.",

    "text": "Investing in an annuity within a tax-deferred account, such as an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) will provide no additional \ntax savings. This guide will help you by discussing the fees, expenses and tax implications associated with annuities, as well as \nthe compensation paid to TIS. \nThis guide seeks to be broadly informative, but it cannot address completely the features and benefits of any particular annuity\ncontract. Thus, with respect to any specific annuity you choose to consider, please remember that the policy contract,\ndisclosure materials, and/or prospectus of the annuity itself are always the governing documents. It is important \nthat you read these documents carefully. Please contact your TIS financial professional with any questions you may have \nabout annuities or other investments. \nAbout Annuities \nAn annuity is a contract issued by an insurance company that provides one or more investment choices and allows your money \nto grow tax deferred until it is withdrawn. In return for the premiums you pay, the issuing insurance company pledges to\nreturn your funds in the future, including earnings if occurred, or to make a series of guaranteed periodic payments (called\nannuitization) to you or anyone else you specify. Annuities can be purchased by making a single payment or by making a series \nof payments over time. Guarantees, including interest rates and subsequent income payouts are backed by the claims-paying \nability of the issuing company. \nAnnuity contracts are generally designed for long-term retirement savings and should not be considered a short-term investment\noption.",

Other variable \nannuity share classes exist, such as Class L and Class C-share variable annuities, but these are not offered by TIS. \nAnnuity features vary from state to state, so ask your TIS financial professional about the products and features that are\navailable in your state. \nAnnuity Fees and Expenses \nThere are certain charges and expenses associated with annuities. The policy documents, disclosure materials, and/or \nprospectus of each annuity will describe the charges you pay, including annual operating expenses. Be sure you understand \nthese expenses before you invest. \nSurrender Charges \nAnnuity contracts are designed for long-term investment and generally assess a surrender charge for early withdrawals and/or\nearly policy surrenders. If you withdraw money or surrender the contract within a specified period of time after investing, the\ninsurance company typically assesses a surrender charge. When you purchase an annuity, your surrender charges, if any, will\nbe specifically discussed with you and disclosed in a written document. Some annuities do not have a surrender charge period \nor surrender charges. \nSurrender charges are usually calculated as a percentage of the purchase payment withdrawn and decline gradually over the\nsurrender charge period. For example, an 8% surrender charge might apply in the first year after investing, 7% in the second\nyear, 6% in the third year, and so on, until the surrender charge no longer applies.",

Annual account management\nfees typically range from $0 to up to $100 annually depending on the assets invested and maintained in a contract. Fees for \nasset management and subaccount maintenance typically range from 0.35% to 2% depending on the subaccount selected. \nVariable and Fixed Indexed Annuity Features \nVariable and fixed indexed annuities available through TIS offer many features. These features could be included as part of the\nunderlying variable and fixed indexed annuity contract, or they could be optional features or riders that you can elect at the\ntime of purchase or in the future, depending on the rules of the rider set forth by the annuity carrier. This approach gives you\nthe ability to select and pay only for the features you need. Optional features typically carry an additional annual charge,\nexpressed as an annual percent of either the account value or the benefit base value.",

A Truist MLCD constitutes a senior unsecured obligation of Truist Bank. Purchasers of Truist Bank-\nissued MLCDs should be comfortable with the creditworthiness of Truist Bank as issuer of the MLCD. \nMarket-Linked Note (\u201cMLN\u201d) \nMLNs differ from MLCDs in that they are securities and not FDIC insured. Like MLCDs, MLNs offer a return based on an \nunderlying market measure (as listed above). However, depending on the payout formula, the protection of principal may be\nfull, partial, or contingent upon certain events. An MLN is generally structured by issuers with the combination of two \ncomponents: \n1.) A non-interest earning debt security, and \n2.) One or more hedging instruments that provide you the potential return based on the specified market measure. \nStructured notes are unsecured debt obligations of the issuer and are subject to the risk of default by the issuer (similar to any\ntraditional corporate bond). Creditworthiness corresponds to the ability of the issuer to pay interest and repay the principal of \nthe structured investment. Structured note holders may lose up to 100% of their investment upon the bankruptcy of the\nissuer, even if the value of the referenced asset is favorable.",

In addition to the reference \nasset\u2019s performance, other factors that may affect the investment value of the structured product prior to maturity include:\ninterest rates, volatility of the underlying asset, liquidity, time remaining until maturity, and creditworthiness of the underlying\nissuer. \nStructured products often pay interest on the maturity date (unless periodic interest payments are payable on a series of \nstructured products). The amount of interest payable, if any, is determined by reference to a market measure or measures. In\nsuch case, interest will be calculated based upon the market measure level or price observed on specific date(s) during the\nterm of the product. Therefore, the interest paid on the structured product might differ substantially from the amount of\ninterest that would be calculated by observing the specified market measure on different dates during the same period. \n2025-04-0651 \nTIS Investing Guide Page 15 of 22",

This limited access to all available investment products as well as\nproducts that are only available if investment amount thresholds are satisfied creates conflicts of interest.

Depending upon the level of investment activity, the commissions charged to your\nbrokerage account can be higher or lower than if you chose to select a fee-based investment advisory program managed by\nour affiliate, TAS. \nFee based investment advisory programs typically assess ongoing fees based on the amount of assets managed in the\ninvestment advisory program and, therefore, under particular circumstances, prolonged periods of inactivity can result in\nhigher investment advisory compensation than if commissions were paid separately for individual transactions through a \nbrokerage account. You should consider the value of the services provided when making comparisons between brokerage and\ninvestment advisory accounts.",

TIS mitigates the conflict of interest created by\nthese referrals by disclosing it to its clients, requiring a supervisory review for each referral opportunity and an annual review\nfor each applicable BIP design. \nMonthly Commissions and Annual Revenue Award: Truist Advisors receive incentive awards based on their monthly and \nannual aggregated revenue generated for TIS, TAS and their Affiliates in connection with purchases of investment products, \ninvestment advisory services and other financial products offered by TIS, TAS and their Affiliates, by the Truist Advisor\u2019s clients. \nThe compensation rate increases in percentage amounts as the amount of the revenue generated by the Truist Advisor\u2019s \nassociated client base increases. \nAdvisor Loans: Loans may be offered to certain Truist Advisors upon employment.

    "text": "Because Truist Advisors\u2019 incentive compensation programs (other than the New Accounts Bonus described above) are closely \ntied to the amount of revenue generated for TIS, TAS, and their Affiliates by each Truist Advisor, Truist Advisors have a financial \nincentive to recommend higher cost products and services, which can provide higher amounts of compensation to TIS, TAS, \nand their Affiliates, rather than other comparable products and services to their clients. The financial incentives to recommend \nonly investment products which provide compensation to TIS, TAS, and their Affiliates, and the applicable Truist Advisor, and \nto recommend higher cost investment products can encourage Truist Advisors to make investment recommendations for \nreasons other than a client\u2019s specific investment needs and therefore creates a conflict of interest in connection with Truist \nAdvisors\u2019 investment recommendations to their clients. We address this conflict of interest by disclosing it to our clients and by \nrequiring supervision of recommendations to clients in accordance with industry regulations. \nIn addition, the New Accounts Bonus and other programs described above create compensation-based incentives for Truist\nAdvisors who were previously employed by other firms to encourage clients of their former firm to open new accounts with TIS\nand TAS, and therefore Truist Advisors have a financial conflict of interest in making such recommendations.",
